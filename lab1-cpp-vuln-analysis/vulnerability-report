# Vulnerability Report (Beginner-Friendly Summary)

**Project:** Simple C++ Input Program  
**Tools Used:** cppcheck, flawfinder  
**Environment:** GitHub Codespaces (Ubuntu)

## 1. Purpose of This Report

I’m currently learning the basics of software security, and this lab was my first attempt at scanning code for vulnerabilities. The goal wasn’t to be perfect, but to understand how tools like cppcheck and flawfinder work and how to explain the issues they find in a clear way.

---

## 2. Summary of Issues Found

Even in a very small C++ program, I found a few common security risks:

- Use of the unsafe `strcpy()` function  
- Fixed-size character buffers with no checks  
- No validation on the user’s input  
- No error handling  

These issues are small in a learning project, but they can lead to serious problems in real-world applications.

## 3. Detailed Findings (Easy-to-Understand Explanations)

### **Finding 1 — Unsafe Use of `strcpy()`**
**What the tool showed:**  
`strcpy` was flagged as a high-risk function.

**In beginner terms:**  
`strcpy()` copies text without checking if it fits.  
If the input is too long, it can “spill over” into memory it shouldn’t touch.  
That’s called a **buffer overflow**, which can crash a program or be exploited.

**Fix:**  
Use `strncpy()` or check the input size before copying.

### **Finding 2 — Fixed-Size Buffers Without Limits**
**What I saw:**  
The program uses:

```cpp
char input[10];
char buffer[10];
